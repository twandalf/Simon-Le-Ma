The album starts where [‘The Housewarming LP’]({{< ref "housewarming.md" >}}) ends and continues the story of someone who screwed up a housewarming party. ‘Train of Thought’ is a train ride with a hangover and a broken heart. 

Loyal Dog is situated halfway through that train ride, starting in the middle of the thought process. It is a song about blind desire and alienation.
