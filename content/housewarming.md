The album is a chronological concept album about a housewarming going from bad to worse.

'Hey Man' is a song from the perspective of your friends: the people who can easily identify your melodramatic bubble of self-pity and puncture it with a single word.

Whenever we become too attached to our own dignity, we become anxious around any situation that might threaten it. When we take ourselves too seriously, we start to compare our knowledge, skills and lives to those of others. When left unchecked, we can become jealous, miserable and unfriendly towards the people around us. Sometimes you need a friend holding up a mirror to understand that.

I also made this song to remind myself that nobody knows what they're doing. This insight helps me to accept my flaws and my often stupid behaviour. Focusing on the things and people that I have is much more fun than frantically worrying about all the things that I don't have. These underlying ideas make the song one of my favourites on the album and I really like playing it live.
